# Gluco-Monitor (DIY)

Gluco-Monitor is an open-source, low-cost device designed to display real-time glucose data from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems such as **FreeStyle Libre** or **Dexcom**.

This project was originally developed to provide a simple, always-visible glucose display for everyday use — without needing to constantly check a smartphone.

## 🚀 Features

* 📊 Real-time glucose display
* 📈 Trend indication (rising, falling, stable)
* 🕒 History visualization at a glance
* 📡 Wireless data retrieval from CGM apps (e.g., Libre / Dexcom)
* 💡 Simple and clean interface
* 🔧 Fully DIY and open-source
* 💰 Low cost (~$25)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Modern CGM systems like the FreeStyle Libre continuously measure glucose levels and transmit data to a smartphone every minute via Bluetooth ([FreeStyle][1]).

Gluco-Monitor connects to this ecosystem by retrieving glucose data (via compatible apps or APIs) and displaying it on a dedicated screen.

This allows users to:

* See their glucose instantly without unlocking their phone
* Monitor trends more easily
* Improve daily diabetes management

## 🛠️ Hardware

Typical components include:

* ESP32-based board
* Small TFT display
* Power supply (USB or battery)

👉 Total cost is typically around **$25**

---

## 💻 Software

The firmware is developed using:

* Arduino / PlatformIO
* Wi-Fi connectivity for data access
* Lightweight graphical interface
